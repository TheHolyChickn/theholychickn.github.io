            <p>I go by The Holy Chicken online, and I'm my junior year of undergrad, studying physics and math. I'm an ex-top skyblock player, and could also be considered an ex-skyblock youtuber. I'm interested in higher category theory and homotopy theory, as well as their applications to physics, especially
              formal QFT. I'm also developing multiple projects, mainly to improve LaTeX workflow, but also to make my desktop look cooler.</p>

            <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
            <p>I work on a number of projects, which can be found on my <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> page. When I purchased a new laptop for college, I opted to install Linux on it instead of daily driving Windows, because I hate Windows 11. Ricing my desktop gave me some basic
            experience with the terminal, and made me realize that if an application or feature that I want doesn't already exist, I can probably just make it myself. Basically all of my projects start via this mentality, generally along with some inspiration from a preexisting project.</p>

            <h2 id="skyblock">Skyblock</h2>
            <p>No one really cares about this, but I want to remember my accomplishments in this game, so I'll record them here. I focused mainly on dungeons, and peaked at #2 in cata xp. I held #1 tank xp for a fairly long time, before I started playing less and lost the spot. I was the 79th cata 50 (August 7th, 2021),
            the 17th class average 50 (August 31st, 2022), the first tank 60 (I have no idea), and ended my career at cata 81 when that was still top 10. Around 9 months after I fully quit, my account is still top 5 in tank experience somehow.</p>
