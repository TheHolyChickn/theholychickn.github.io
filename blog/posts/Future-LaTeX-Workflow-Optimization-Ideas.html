                <p>I have a lot of ideas for projects to make or things to implement, but often don't have time to implement any of these.
                I have decided to begin listing my ideas here, partially as a sort of todo list for myself, but partially in the hopes that
                someone else (who is hopefully better than me at coding) will like the idea enough to make it themselves, before I get around
                to making it next year.</p>

                <p>This article assumes familiarity with some of my other blog posts, or at least a working knowledge of my LaTeX setup.</p>

                <h2 id="support-for-projects">Support for Projects, GUI-Based Solution</h2>
                <p>I often engage in projects outside of coursework, such as independent readings, that would benefit greatly from being integrated
                into my university setup as if they were courses on their own. I was actually thinking of a gui solution insted of pure cli,
                likely using <a href="https://github.com/aylur/ags">ags</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aylur/astral">astral</a>. The gui
                solution would implement the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overview of all current classes and projects</li>
                    <li>A button or something to access <i>all</i> course/projects, including old and archived ones</li>
                    <li>A readout of the active course, today's course schedule, and a list of homeworks due within the next week</li>
                    <li>A button or something to create a new project, which would then run through a series of short prompts to gather
                    information about the new project, before generating it from a predefined template</li>
                    <li>A "new semester" button, which would run the user through a series of prompts, asking for
                        <ul>
                            <li>the new <code>ROOT</code> directory, which would then be set in <code>config.py</code> (directory is created if it does not exist)</li>
                            <li>the number of courses, and then the names of each course (directories for each course are created if they do not exist)</li>
                            <li>the necessary information for each course in order to complete the <code>info.yaml</code> for each one</li>
                        </ul>
                    and then it would create all relevant files and activate all courses, just like the current <code>init-all-courses.py</code> does</li>
                    <li>There could be a new <code>config.json</code> file created, which would store some important information instead of having to enter
                    it into <code>config.py</code> every time</li>
                </ul>
                This could be bundled into a package on the AUR, and could even come with a refactor of Castel's scripts into Rust or something.

                <h2 id="dynamic-preamble-selection">Dynamic Preamble Selection</h2>
                <p>My preambles are fairly modular, and individual preamble file components can be easily added, swapped with others, or removed
                altogether. Although this modularity is very nice, it is annoying to have to manually import a sequence of preamble files for
                each document. The obvious solution is to create a way to dynamically import preamble files. It would probably be prudent to
                create a central directory of preamble files, and a json file listing each preamble file, along with a <i>very</i> short
                description of it, which could show up in whatever menu we use to select the relevant preamble file.</p>

                <p>From here, we would need to construct some kind of menu. I would suggest making a nvim plugin and creating the menu directly
                in nvim, but that feels impractical. I may very well be wrong here; I have never written an nvim plugin. However, I think using
                something like rofi would be the more natural choice here. </p>

                <h2 id="section-three-lists-and-quotes">Lists and Quotes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>First list item for section three.</li>
                    <li>Second list item with <code>inline_code_example()</code>.</li>
                    <li>Third list item.</li>
                </ul>
