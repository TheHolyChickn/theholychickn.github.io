                <p>I have a lot of ideas for projects to make or things to implement, but often don't have time to implement any of these.
                I have decided to begin listing my ideas here, partially as a sort of todo list for myself, but partially in the hopes that
                someone else (who is hopefully better than me at coding) will like the idea enough to make it themselves, before I get around
                to making it next year.</p>

                <p>This article assumes familiarity with some of my other blog posts, or at least a working knowledge of my LaTeX setup.</p>

                <h2 id="support-for-projects">Support for Projects, GUI-Based Solution</h2>
                <p>I often engage in projects outside of coursework, such as independent readings, that would benefit greatly from being integrated
                into my university setup as if they were courses on their own. I was actually thinking of a gui solution instead of pure cli,
                likely using some implementation of gdk widgets, such as the JavaScript library gjs. The gui solution would implement the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overview of all current classes and projects</li>
                    <li>A button or something to access <i>all</i> course/projects, including old and archived ones</li>
                    <li>A readout of the active course, today's course schedule, and a list of homeworks due within the next week</li>
                    <li>A button or something to create a new project, which would then run through a series of short prompts to gather
                    information about the new project, before generating it from a predefined template</li>
                    <li>A "new semester" button, which would run the user through a series of prompts, asking for
                        <ul>
                            <li>the new <code>ROOT</code> directory, which would then be set in <code>config.py</code> (directory is created if it does not exist)</li>
                            <li>the number of courses, and then the names of each course (directories for each course are created if they do not exist)</li>
                            <li>the necessary information for each course in order to complete the <code>info.yaml</code> for each one</li>
                        </ul>
                    and then it would create all relevant files and activate all courses, just like the current <code>init-all-courses.py</code> does</li>
                    <li>There could be a new <code>config.json</code> file created, which would store some important information instead of having to enter
                    it into <code>config.py</code> every time</li>
                </ul>
                This could be bundled into a package on the AUR, and could even come with a refactor of Castel's scripts into Rust or something.

                <h2 id="dynamic-preamble-selection">Dynamic Preamble Selection</h2>
                <p>My preambles are somewhat modular; I have a base preamble file, and a couple different preambles I can choose from for theorem
                styles, hyperref and code styles, including physics commands, and some conventions such as category names. However, it can be
                annoying to input a list of multiple preambles for each LaTeX file. The obvious solution is to create a way to dynamically import
                preamble files, which would be selected based on a universal json that lists all preambles, and a brief description of each one.</p>

                <p>From here, we would need to construct some kind of menu. I would suggest making a nvim plugin and creating the menu directly
                in nvim, but that feels impractical. I may very well be wrong here; I have never written an nvim plugin. However, I think using
                something like rofi would be the more natural choice here.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Active preambles could be indicated by marking them as urgent or something maybe</li>
                    <li>There are obviously different classes of preamble files, and listing all of them would be difficult. We can have a
                    list of categories, and each one expands into a list of valid preambles. This could be pre-configured in the config file.
                    I know this is possible without closing the rofi menu I need to find the code for it though</li>
                    <li>Selecting a preamble would input <code>\input{/path/to/selected/file}</code> in a specified section of the preamble,
                    likely defined by wrapping it in special comments. There could be an option to autogenerate these comments as well.
                    Deselecting a preamble would remove it from the file</li>
                    <li>This would be a combo of nvim configging and external scripts - external scripts to manage the rofi environment and
                    text to be inputted, and a keybind defined in nvim which would run the script, then insert the relevant code when prompted</li>
                    <li>Incorporating with the previous idea, we could also have a config file for each project, and the active preambles could
                    be listed there. It might make implementation cleaner, but would require a defined project environment to implement</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="dynamic-snippets">Dynamic Snippets</h2>
                <p>This is very similar to the above suggestion. Instead of having a central hub of snippets, and putting project-specific
                snippets in an extra folder/file, we could have snippets be dynamically loaded based on the needs of a given LaTeX file.</p>

                <p>My first idea seems less plausible. A script would be called when a LaTeX file is opened, which would read the preamble of
                the LaTeX file. It would pull important information such as documentclass and the preamble files used. It would compare these
                against a manually written json config file, which would tell it which snippet files to load. We could also make it so when
                preambles are added/removed according to the above idea, snippets could be added/removed in accordance with the preambles.</p>

                <p>The simpler and more achievable idea would be to include a list of snippet file directories to be used in each project/course
                folder, and the nvim config would be modified to only load those files. This would only work in environments managed by
                suggestion 1, and would be less modular, but would be much simpler. This json could be autogenerated on project creation, and
                modifications could be handled by the script managing preamble switching. Using this method, snippet additions/subtractions may
                require nvim restarts to take effect.</p>

                <h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I could write a nvim plugin for references. It could find the bib file in the project directory using the config file in
                    the working directory (from my first idea), or it can just default to the working directory, and then when a <code>\cite</code>
                    is written, it would push the bib references into the nvim buffer and display them.</li>
                    <li>We could add git integration into project 1, which is mostly cosmetic, but could also add <code>push</code> and <code>commit</code>
                    buttons or something.</li>
                    <li>Notifications when compile fails, with an explanation as to why. Can be done via nvim plugin w/ an nvim notification.</li>
                    <li>Add an artifact option to clean aux files to "artifact" projects and remove them from the running projects list.</li>
                    <li>An option to log working time and display it.</li>
                    <li>In the universal json for modular preambles, each entry can come with a dependency entry, so entries look like
                    <pre><code class="language-json">{
    "file-name": "FILE NAME",
    "description": "FILE DESCRIPTION",
    "dependencies": [
        any dependencies would go here
    ]
}</code></pre></li>
                    <li>An addition to idea 1 that allows users to define their own preamble templates from the modular preambles in the gui</li>
                    <li>The universal json is universal with respect to jsons</li>
                </ul>
