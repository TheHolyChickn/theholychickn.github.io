        <p>This page is still a work in progress, come back later!</p>

        <p>Obligatory credit to the late <a href="https://castel.dev">Gilles Castel</a> for sharing his LaTeX setup, which served both as inspiration and as a foundation for this project. Rest in peace king.</p>
        <!--<h2 id="section-one">Overview</h2>
        <p>LaTeX hub is a Linux based application that makes working with projects and course files in LaTeX extremely easy, even for those with little to no programming experience.</p>
        <p>All the original functionality of Gilles Castel's setup is included, including commands to create/edit lecture files, initiate course files, dynamically switch the active course based on a Google calendar, and so on. Read his <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-3/">third blog post</a>
          for a better description of these features (or just read the project's <a href="https://github.com/TheHolyChickn/latex-hub/wiki/Documentation">documentation</a>, which is honestly better). His setup also includes an extension I made to manage homework assignments. The cli-based
          implementation has been kept, and all gui elements that will be discussed later are <i>in addition to</i> the cli implementation.</p>
        <p>The functionality of the project also extends to  "LaTeX projects", which are basically files other than lecture notes. </p>

        <h3 id="subsection-a">Customization</h3>

        <h2 id="section-two">Developer's Remarks</h2>
        <p>I didn't originally intend to release the project publicly, so I was (and am still not) worried about cross-platform compatibility. I use Linux, and am only concerned with compatibility within Linux. I have some familiarity working with Gtk widgets, so with all this in mind, I decided
          to make the Gui with Gtk, and ended up choosing to implement it in JavaScript. I have absolutely no knowledge of JavaScript, so a <i>lot</i> of the code is AI generated, and the parts written by me are likely much worse. If you would like to modify the code yourself, proceed with caution
          I guess.</p>
